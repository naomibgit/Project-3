# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Naomi Berryman**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**AnimalApps** is an Android app where I recreated a selected app screen but transformed it into an adorable animal-themed layout. The project required understanding ConstraintLayout, positioning UI elements, styling, and rebuilding the screen from scratch based on the chosen inspiration screenshot.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🐾📱🎨**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate  
  - I added my chosen screenshot in the section below.
- [x] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot  
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout  
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView  
- [x] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews  

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables  
- [x] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources  
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views  
- [ ] Create a second layout for an original app idea  

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Added improved spacing and padding for a cleaner, modern UI  
- [x] Added a themed color palette to match the chosen animal concept  

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the **App Store / Apple Music-style card layout** app:

*(Replace with your actual screenshot path — if you want, I can embed it for you.)*

## Original App Layout (Optional Stretch Feature)

*(Only include if you actually built a second layout)*

Here is my entry for the optional stretch feature:

It is for an app that **displays a cute animal profile card with fun facts.**

## Notes

- This project helped me improve my skills with ConstraintLayout and UI arrangement.
- I learned how to recreate real app designs and translate them into Android XML.
- Styling ImageViews, TextViews, and buttons helped me better understand layout hierarchy.
- Custom fonts and shape drawables gave me more control over branding and aesthetics.
